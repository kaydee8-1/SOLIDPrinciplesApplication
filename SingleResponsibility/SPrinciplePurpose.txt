According to SOLID principles, each class should handle only single responsibility (calculating, printing, saving etc.) 
and has only single reason to change (change of data model, business logic, database logic etc.)

Benefits:

1. It makes the version control easier leading to:  
    - quicker understanding of made commits
    - avoiding complicated merge conflicts
    
2. It eventually simplifies collaboration of many teams preventing incompatibility of modules.
