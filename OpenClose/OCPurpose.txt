The Open Close principle defines the goal of OO Architecture - to makes the architecture ready for extension and avoid 
the need to modify the already written source code. Interfaces help with that. They provide a "contract" for new
implementations. We can create many concrete implementations for one interface which will particularly useful when 
creating further a class that manages various of these implementation, instead of building separate class for each.

Benefits:
 
 - Simplicity of adding new functionality
 
 - Reducing the amount of code when having build a class to manage all interfaces implementations 
 
 - Reducing the scope of modification when modification is needed
